Crystal singing bowls are musical instruments made from pure quartz, known for their long, resonant tones used in meditation, yoga, and sound healing (sound baths) to promote relaxation, clarity, and chakra balance, with each bowl often tuned to specific notes corresponding to the body's energy centres.

They produce powerful vibrations that influence brainwaves and encourage deep therapeutic effects.

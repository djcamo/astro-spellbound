Gemstone terminator pendants are powerful little conduits of energy, shaped to focus, direct and amplify intention.

With a pointed end at both top and bottom, they symbolise balance, grounding and expansion.

Worn close to the heart, a terminator pendant becomes a quiet ally, helping energy flow with clarity and purpose while supporting your intentions throughout the day.

Palo Santo was used by the indigenous people of South America and usage dates back to the Incan era.

Traditionally used by shamans to clear misfortune, negative energy and "evil spirits', and common today as a type of incense, or used as an alternative to white sage or other herbs.

Our Palo Santo or ‘Holy Wood’ is ethically harvested in Peru under strict government regulations.

A brass singing bowl is a hand-beaten or machined metal bowl used for meditation, yoga, sound healing, and spiritual rituals.

A mallet is used to create resonant, harmonising sounds which promote relaxation, focus, mindfulness and stress relief by generating vibrations believed to balance the body's energy.

Different size bowls create different sounds.  Prices vary depending on the size of the bowl.

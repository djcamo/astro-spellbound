            <p>Saging—or smudging—a house is a powerful ritual used to cleanse negative energy and invite positivity into your space.
            <p>Whether you're moving into a new home, recovering from emotional stress, or simply refreshing your environment, here's a step-by-step guide to doing it right.
            <h4 class="pb-2">Step-by-Step Guide to Saging Your Home</h4>
            <ol>
               <li><span>Prepare Your Space</span>
                  <p> Open windows and doors to allow negative energy to exit.
                  <p> Tidy up beforehand—physical clutter can block energetic flow.
               </li>
               <li> <span>Gather Your Tools</span>
                  <p> Use a sage bundle (white sage is most common), a fireproof dish (like an abalone shell), and optionally a feather to direct the smoke.
               </li>
               <li><span>Set Your Intention</span>
                  <p> Before lighting the sage, mentally or verbally state your purpose—e.g., “I cleanse this space of all negativity.”
               </li>
               <li> <span>Light the Sage</span>
                  <p> Light the tip of the bundle and let it burn for about 20 seconds, then gently blow it out to produce smoke.
               </li>
               <li> <span>Smudge Yourself First</span>
                  <p> Waft the smoke around your body, starting from your feet and moving upward.
               </li>
               <li> <span>Smudge the House</span>
                  <p> Begin in the furthest room from the entrance and move clockwise through each space.
                  <p> Pay special attention to corners, doorways, and windows—these areas tend to trap stagnant energy.
               </li>
               <li> <span>Let the Sage Burn Out Naturally</span>
                  <p> Once finished, place the bundle in your fireproof dish and allow it to extinguish on its own.
               </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Saging isn't just about smoke—it's about intention, respect, and mindfulness. Done with care, it can transform your home into a sanctuary of peace and clarity. Want help crafting a personal smudging mantra or exploring other cleansing rituals like palo santo or sound healing? I’ve got ideas.

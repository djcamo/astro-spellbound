Denise has many years of experience offering different healing modalities including Massage, Reflexology, & Reiki.

Denise offers Crystal Bed Healings by appointment in our healing space on Wednesday afternoons.

A session begins with a gentle mini meditation, then involves you relaxing fully clothed on a treatment bed under 7 beautiful crystal lights for approx 30 mins, & then ends with some grounding back into your physical body.

The coloured light rays help with physical, mental and spiritual energy imbalances.

Please contact us on 85232460 to book a session.
